    <h3>Legal Driving Age</h3>
    <h3>You can test for equality, but you may need to test to see
        how a number compares to a known value and display a
        message if the number is too low or too high.
        Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare
        it to the legal driving age of sixteen. If the user is sixteen or
        older, then the program should display “You are old enough
        to legally drive.” If the user is under sixteen, the program
        should display “You are not old enough to legally drive.”</h3>
